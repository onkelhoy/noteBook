# noteBook
This is a school system for teachers to create sessions for their students i.e. a task that the students will need to write. The teacher provides the task of course, the word count and sets the date when the session should be opened and closed. The system will then atomaticly open on the right time and close it, then the teacher will have 30 days to finish commenting all the submits.
When a session is open the teacher will see who is online, who is writing and who isn't.
There is a admin page to that controls the teachers.

For the student: 
When logged in they will goto writing page if they only have one session on them (task), if more they will go to session list were they can pick one. The countdown will always be displayed and the word count. It's autosave. 
When a session is done they will be able to see their work and see the teacher comment (they recive an email when session is open and when techer comments)
